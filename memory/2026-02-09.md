## Key Patterns from API SaaS Businesses

### Revenue Benchmarks (from Starter Story)

| Business | Revenue | Startup Cost | Team | Key Insight |
|----------|---------|--------------|------|-------------|
| Fomo | $1.08M/year | $0 | 5 | Acquired existing tool, scaled 600% via integrations |
| Bannerbear | $600K/year | $500 | 1 | API for image automation, $49-299 pricing |
| Spurwing | $600K/year | $100K | 3 | Scheduling API, saved devs from building from scratch |
| Geocode.xyz | $360K/year | $10 | 2 | Geolocation API, 100M+ monthly calls |
| Scrapingdog | $264K/year | $300 | 6 | Web scraping API, SEO-driven growth |
| Treblle | $60K/year | ? | 2 | API management tool, raised $1.4M seed |
| Tinq.ai | $43.2K/year | ? | 0 | NLP toolkit, $0 ad spend, organic only |

### Critical Patterns for VixPic

**1. Low Startup Cost = High ROI**
- Geocode.xyz: $10 → $360K/year (36,000x!)
- Scrapingdog: $300 → $264K/year
- Bannerbear: $500 → $600K/year
- VixPic should stay lean. No need for massive infrastructure.

**2. SEO is the Engine**
- Scrapingdog: "SEO is our primary growth driver"
- Geocode.xyz: Organic developer traffic
- Bannerbear: Content marketing + integrations
- **VixPic action:** Target "free AI image generator no credits", "BYOK image AI"

**3. Single-Person Teams Can Hit $600K/year**
- Bannerbear (Jon Yongfook) = 1 person, $600K
- Proves solo founder with API tool can scale

**4. Solve a Pain Point Developers Already Feel**
- Spurwing: "Developing custom scheduling solutions is complex"
- Scrapingdog: "Web scraping infrastructure is painful"
- **VixPic equivalent:** "Managing AI image API keys across services is painful"

## Resource Framework for Bootstrapped Learning

### Tier 1: Real-Time Community (Validation)
- **Indie Hackers** - Filter by revenue, see what's working NOW
- Use for: Idea validation, current tactics, peer feedback
- Action: Post VixPic progress, get community feedback

### Tier 2: Curated Case Studies (Strategy)
- **Starter Story** - Structured interviews with metrics
- Use for: Go-to-market playbooks, competitive analysis
- Action: Study 5 similar BYOK/API-wrapper businesses

### Tier 3: Expert Talks (Deep Learning)
- **MicroConf Video Vault** - 170+ hours FREE
- Use for: Pricing, positioning, scaling frameworks
- Action: Watch talks on pricing psychology, LTD models

### Tier 4: Longitudinal Studies (Execution)
- **TinySeed Tales podcast** - Follow founders over months
- Use for: Understanding the "messy middle"
- Insight: Post-launch, pre-scale is where most fail

### Tier 5: Quantitative Evidence
- **Baremetrics Open Startups** - Real MRR/churn data
- Use for: Benchmarking, realistic expectations

## VixPic Strategic Refinements

### Confirmed Advantages
1. **Low startup cost** - Client-side architecture = minimal infra
2. **SEO-able niche** - BYOK is a specific search intent
3. **Solo-scalable** - Bannerbear proves API tools can hit $50K MRR with 1 person

### New Hypotheses to Test
1. **Developer-first positioning** - API businesses thrive with dev audiences
2. **Integrations as growth lever** - Fomo grew 600% via integrations
3. **Usage-based or tiered pricing** - $49-299 range works for API tools

### Content Marketing Ideas
- "How to use your OpenAI API key for image generation"
- "BYOK vs subscription: calculating true cost of AI images"
- "Build your own AI image pipeline (without monthly fees)"
- Target developers AND power users (different personas)

## Next Research Topics
- [ ] MicroConf Video Vault: LTD pricing psychology
- [ ] Bannerbear deep-dive (closest comparable to VixPic)
- [ ] Open startup metrics for image/AI tools
- [ ] Integration marketplace strategies (Zapier, Make.com)

## 17:00 UTC - Build Session: Core Image Generation API

### What Was Built

**New: `/app/api/generate/route.ts`** - Real image generation API
- Implements all 4 providers: Replicate, FAL.ai, OpenAI, Together AI
- Replicate: Uses `/v1/models/{model}/predictions` endpoint with `Prefer: wait` for sync mode
- FAL: Queue-based API with direct response
- OpenAI: DALL-E 2 & 3 with size mapping for aspect ratios
- Together: Standard images/generations endpoint

**Updated: Generate Page**
- Connected to real API instead of placeholder images
- Download button: Fetches blob and triggers download
- Regenerate button: Calls handleGenerate again
- Copy Prompt button: Uses clipboard API

### Technical Notes

**Replicate FLUX models:**
- Use `aspect_ratio` parameter instead of `width/height`
- Supported: 1:1, 16:9, 9:16, etc.
- `output_format: 'webp'` for better compression
- Sync mode via `Prefer: wait` header (faster for FLUX Schnell ~1-4s)

**API Key Security:**
- Keys sent per-request from client localStorage
- Server doesn't store keys - uses immediately, discards
- CORS handled by Next.js API routes

### Commit
```
feat: implement real image generation API
commit e7e4e9b → pushed to origin/main
```

### Server Note
- Build verification failed due to OOM (only 64MB free RAM on 4GB server)
- Code verified manually - TypeScript types look correct
- Will need testing with actual API keys

### Next Steps
- [ ] Test with real API keys (Replicate first - cheapest)
- [ ] Add loading progress indicator (polling status)
- [ ] Error message UX improvements
- [ ] Image history gallery improvements
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel for production testing
