### AI Startup Capital Efficiency Benchmarks

**From Market Clarity's analysis of 35 AI startups:**

| Company | Monthly Revenue | Team Size | Raised | Revenue/Employee |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **Midjourney** | $42M | 40 | $0 | **$1.05M/employee** |
| **Cursor** | $42M | <20 | $400M | ~$2.1M/employee |
| OpenAI | $1.08B | 3,200+ | $13B+ | ~$337K/employee |
| Anthropic | $417M | 1,000+ | $8B+ | ~$417K/employee |

**The Midjourney Model (VixPic-relevant):**
- $500M ARR, 40 employees, $0 raised
- Community-first via Discord (not typical marketing)
- Subscription-based monetization
- Extreme focus on product quality over scaling
- Maintained independence through bootstrapping
- $1M+ revenue per employee

**Cursor's Path:**
- $500M ARR with <20 people
- AI coding assistant (dev tools vertical)
- Raised $400M but operates lean
- ~$2.1M revenue per employee

**Insight:** Capital efficiency is now a competitive advantage. Midjourney proves $0 raised → $500M ARR is possible in AI image space.
