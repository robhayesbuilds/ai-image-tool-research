3. **Research findings:**

   - Facebook groups remain the biggest opportunity (150K+ combined members)
   - Web search confirms Sept 2026 deadline is well-documented across French business media

### Current Blockers (unchanged)
- Vercel deployment not auto-updating (articles 18-24+ not live)

### Next Session Priorities

3. Draft podcast outreach emails (BFM Business, La Micro By Flo)
4. Consider writing more niche profession guides (notaries, real estate agents)

## Research Session (14:00 UTC / 21:00 Bangkok)

### Context
Scheduled cron job for studying Starter Story and SaaS resources.

### Sources Studied
1. Trackboxx: "10 SaaS startups that earned billions in 2025"
2. Starter Story: SaaS Company database
3. Micro-SaaS Ideas: ScreenshotAPI case study ($0 → $10K MRR in 10 months)

### Key Frameworks Extracted

**1. Industry Expertise Moat**
- Top 2025 SaaS cos focused on specific industries, not horizontal tools
- TitleCapture: $8K → $4M ARR focusing just on title insurance quoting
- $3.5B invested in industry-specific AI in 2025 (3x prior year)
- ✅ FacturSimple already correctly positioned here

**2. AI-Native Foundation Rule**
- AI-native SaaS valued 41% higher in seed rounds
- Must be foundation, not bolt-on feature
- 💡 Opportunity: Photo-to-invoice, voice-to-invoice for differentiation

**3. The 40% Marketing Rule**
- Solo founders: spend 40% of time on distribution
- "Distribution > Product" — content marketing 10x more effective than features

**4. Solo Founder Benchmarks**
- MVP in 105 days avg
- $10K MRR achievable in 10 months
- $75 startup cost for micro-SaaS
- 87% gross margins typical

### Full Research Document
Created: `/saas-research/2026-02-06-session.md`

### Insights for FacturSimple
1. Content is ready (32+ articles) — Vercel deploy remains critical blocker
2. Consider AI-native differentiators for MVP
3. Community-first distribution aligns with research findings
4. €9/mo entry price validated by successful case studies

## Autonomous Work Session (14:36 UTC)

### Context
Proactive 15-minute wake triggered by cron job. Focus on communities and strategic content.

### Work Completed

1. **Created B2B Marketing Article** (`factursimple/src/app/blog/guide-expert-comptable-auto-entrepreneur/`)
   - Guide for expert-comptables on helping their AE clients prepare
   - Strategic angle: accountants are gatekeepers who recommend tools
   - Includes checklist to share with clients, FAQ answers, service opportunity ideas
   - CTA for accountant partnership program
   - Added to blog index (featured position)

2. **Updated COMMUNITY_OUTREACH.md** with new communities:

   - Found Village-Justice has active 2026 reform content

### Strategic Insight
The expert-comptable article opens a B2B referral channel. Accountants:

- Can become affiliate partners (recurring referral opportunity)
- Serve multiple clients = multiplier effect

### Current Blockers (unchanged)

### Next Session Priorities
1. Create more B2B content (accountant email templates, referral program page)

3. If Vercel fixed → verify all content live
