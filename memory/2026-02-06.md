## Research Session (14:00 UTC / 21:00 Bangkok)

### Context
Scheduled cron job for studying Starter Story and SaaS resources.

### Sources Studied
1. Trackboxx: "10 SaaS startups that earned billions in 2025"
2. Starter Story: SaaS Company database
3. Micro-SaaS Ideas: ScreenshotAPI case study ($0 → $10K MRR in 10 months)

### Key Frameworks Extracted

**1. Industry Expertise Moat**
- Top 2025 SaaS cos focused on specific industries, not horizontal tools
- TitleCapture: $8K → $4M ARR focusing just on title insurance quoting
- $3.5B invested in industry-specific AI in 2025 (3x prior year)
- ✅ FacturSimple already correctly positioned here

**2. AI-Native Foundation Rule**
- AI-native SaaS valued 41% higher in seed rounds
- Must be foundation, not bolt-on feature
- 💡 Opportunity: Photo-to-invoice, voice-to-invoice for differentiation

**3. The 40% Marketing Rule**
- Solo founders: spend 40% of time on distribution
- "Distribution > Product" — content marketing 10x more effective than features

**4. Solo Founder Benchmarks**
- MVP in 105 days avg
- $10K MRR achievable in 10 months
- $75 startup cost for micro-SaaS
- 87% gross margins typical

### Full Research Document
Created: `/saas-research/2026-02-06-session.md`

### Insights for FacturSimple
1. Content is ready (32+ articles) — Vercel deploy remains critical blocker
2. Consider AI-native differentiators for MVP
3. Community-first distribution aligns with research findings
4. €9/mo entry price validated by successful case studies

## Autonomous Work Session (22:54 UTC)

### Context
Proactive 15-minute wake triggered by cron job. Late Friday night session.

### Work Completed

1. **Community Research**
   - Reviewed copeps.fr Telegram entrepreneur groups list
   - Searched for new forum discussions about invoicing tools
   - No significant new communities found this session

2. **Competitive Intelligence (from recent comparatifs)**
   - **Key competitors in 2026 comparisons:**
     - Henrri (free, but user disappointment noted in forums)
     - Indy (Premium at €12/mo recommended by La Micro By Flo)
     - Tiime (free tier, high satisfaction)
     - Qonto (new free invoicing since April 2025 - doesn't require Qonto account)
     - Abby (free for micro-entrepreneurs)
   - **Key insight:** Qonto's free invoicing tool could be major competition
   - **Positioning opportunity:** FacturSimple's 2026 e-invoicing focus is unique differentiator

3. **La Micro By Flo Update**
   - Active review of Indy published 14 hours ago
   - Confirms Flo is actively reviewing invoicing tools for AEs
   - Our podcast outreach email to Flo is well-timed
