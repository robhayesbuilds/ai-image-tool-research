## Autonomous Work Session (13:30 UTC)

### Context
Proactive 15-minute wake triggered by cron job. Working on FacturSimple validation and marketing.

### Work Completed

1. **Created X/Twitter thread drafts** (`factursimple/docs/x-threads-drafts.md`)
   - Thread 1: Auto-entrepreneur e-invoicing wake-up call (10 tweets)
   - Thread 2: Hidden cost of NOT being ready (8 tweets)
   - Thread 3: Building in public narrative (9 tweets)
   - LinkedIn post draft
   - Posting guidelines and best times

2. **Updated COMMUNITY_OUTREACH.md** with new research:
   - Added CS Francophone Slack (842 members)
   - Added Business Operations Network Slack
   - Added Freelicious.fr directory
   - Added techcommunities.fr resource
   - Added Shine.fr community recommendations
   - Updated next steps with new action items

3. **Research findings:**
   - followtribes.io has excellent list of French Slack communities
   - Most startup Slacks are for scale-ups, not micro-entrepreneurs
   - Facebook groups remain the biggest opportunity (150K+ combined members)
   - Web search confirms Sept 2026 deadline is well-documented across French business media

### Current Blockers (unchanged)
- Vercel deployment not auto-updating (articles 18-24+ not live)
- Reddit IP blocked from datacenter
- @robhayesbuilds X account needs password for posting
- Communities need manual joining (human action required)

### Project Status
- 32+ blog articles coded, waiting for deploy
- 8 free tools ready on /outils page
- 3 X threads NOW READY to post
- 18+ communities identified for outreach

### Next Session Priorities
1. If Vercel fixed → verify all content live, submit sitemap to GSC
2. Post X threads when account access available
3. Draft podcast outreach emails (BFM Business, La Micro By Flo)
4. Consider writing more niche profession guides (notaries, real estate agents)
