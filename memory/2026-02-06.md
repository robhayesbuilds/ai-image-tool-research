## Autonomous Work Session (13:30 UTC)

### Context
Proactive 15-minute wake triggered by cron job. Working on FacturSimple validation and marketing.

### Work Completed

1. **Created X/Twitter thread drafts** (`factursimple/docs/x-threads-drafts.md`)
   - Thread 1: Auto-entrepreneur e-invoicing wake-up call (10 tweets)
   - Thread 2: Hidden cost of NOT being ready (8 tweets)
   - Thread 3: Building in public narrative (9 tweets)
   - LinkedIn post draft
   - Posting guidelines and best times

2. **Updated COMMUNITY_OUTREACH.md** with new research:
   - Added CS Francophone Slack (842 members)
   - Added Business Operations Network Slack
   - Added Freelicious.fr directory
   - Added techcommunities.fr resource
   - Added Shine.fr community recommendations
   - Updated next steps with new action items

3. **Research findings:**
   - followtribes.io has excellent list of French Slack communities
   - Most startup Slacks are for scale-ups, not micro-entrepreneurs
   - Facebook groups remain the biggest opportunity (150K+ combined members)
   - Web search confirms Sept 2026 deadline is well-documented across French business media

### Current Blockers (unchanged)
- Vercel deployment not auto-updating (articles 18-24+ not live)
- Reddit IP blocked from datacenter
- @robhayesbuilds X account needs password for posting
- Communities need manual joining (human action required)

### Project Status
- 32+ blog articles coded, waiting for deploy
- 8 free tools ready on /outils page
- 3 X threads NOW READY to post
- 18+ communities identified for outreach

### Next Session Priorities
1. If Vercel fixed → verify all content live, submit sitemap to GSC
2. Post X threads when account access available
3. Draft podcast outreach emails (BFM Business, La Micro By Flo)
4. Consider writing more niche profession guides (notaries, real estate agents)

## Research Session (14:00 UTC / 21:00 Bangkok)

### Context
Scheduled cron job for studying Starter Story and SaaS resources.

### Sources Studied
1. Trackboxx: "10 SaaS startups that earned billions in 2025"
2. Starter Story: SaaS Company database
3. Micro-SaaS Ideas: ScreenshotAPI case study ($0 → $10K MRR in 10 months)

### Key Frameworks Extracted

**1. Industry Expertise Moat**
- Top 2025 SaaS cos focused on specific industries, not horizontal tools
- TitleCapture: $8K → $4M ARR focusing just on title insurance quoting
- $3.5B invested in industry-specific AI in 2025 (3x prior year)
- ✅ FacturSimple already correctly positioned here

**2. AI-Native Foundation Rule**
- AI-native SaaS valued 41% higher in seed rounds
- Must be foundation, not bolt-on feature
- 💡 Opportunity: Photo-to-invoice, voice-to-invoice for differentiation

**3. The 40% Marketing Rule**
- Solo founders: spend 40% of time on distribution
- "Distribution > Product" — content marketing 10x more effective than features

**4. Solo Founder Benchmarks**
- MVP in 105 days avg
- $10K MRR achievable in 10 months
- $75 startup cost for micro-SaaS
- 87% gross margins typical
