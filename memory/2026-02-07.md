## 23:34 UTC - Cron Job Cleanup Needed

Outdated FacturSimple cron job fired (`5af18f4d-df54-4dd7-961c-df2b6764be8e`). 

**Action:** Ignored per Yassine's pivot instruction to VixPic.
**Issue:** Gateway timeout when trying to disable cron. Need to disable this job manually or retry later.

The job is set to run every 15min for "proactive FacturSimple work" - completely outdated now.

---

*No FacturSimple work done. Pivot to VixPic is in effect.*
