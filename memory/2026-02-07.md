## Research Session (14:00 UTC / 21:00 Bangkok)

### Context
Scheduled cron job for studying Starter Story and SaaS resources.

### Sources Studied
1. **SaaS Operations:** "7 Actionable Bootstrapped SaaS Success Stories & Playbooks for 2025"
2. **Startups for the Rest of Us Ep. 813:** Rob Walling's "SaaS Predictions for 2026"
3. **Entrepreneur Loop:** "10 SaaS Startup Ideas That Will Be Profitable in 2026"
4. **Superframeworks:** "6 AI-Powered Micro-SaaS Ideas for Small Business"
5. **The Successful Projects:** "Senja.io Case Study - $0 to $1M ARR"
6. **Rocking Web:** "1,000 Micro SaaS Analysed: Real Revenue Data [2025 Study]"

### Key Frameworks Extracted

**1. Rob Walling's 2026 Prediction: Horizontal SaaS Headwinds**
- Bootstrapped horizontal SaaS facing massive headwinds from VC-funded AI-first competitors
- Plateaus at $500K-$2M ARR becoming common
- Exception: lifestyle SaaS ($20-40K/mo) with single-channel focus can work
- ✅ FacturSimple correctly positioned as vertical (French AE + e-invoicing)

**2. The Senja.io Playbook ($0 → $1M ARR in 3.75 years)**
- 2-person remote team, 100% bootstrapped
- Build in public on Twitter
- SEO + Product-Led Growth as twin engines
- Widget virality (every embed = organic marketing)
- Narrow focus on creators/indie founders
- Timeline: 30 months from $0 to $30K MRR, then acceleration

**3. Micro-SaaS Reality Check (1,000 companies analyzed)**
- 70% under $1K MRR
- Only 18% reach $1K-$5K MRR "sustainability zone"
- Only 1-2% exceed $50K MRR
- BUT: 95% achieve profitability within 12 months
- Median time to $1M ARR: 2 years 9 months
- Best-in-class: 9 months

**4. AI Integration Is Now Mandatory**
- 67% of new YC companies are AI-focused
- AI-native products grow 2x faster
- 44% of SaaS now charge premium for AI features
- Companies without AI: 40-60% efficiency disadvantage by 2027

**5. Success Factors That Matter**
- Technical founder = 3-5x faster shipping
- Domain expertise (3+ years) = 5-10x better acquisition
- Single channel mastery (40% rely on ONE organic channel)
- Build in public = 3-5x higher engagement

**6. Pricing That Works**
- Hybrid (subscription + usage): 21% median growth
- Annual billing: 30% lower churn, 27% higher customer values
- Freemium: only 3.7% conversion (avoid unless massive scale)

### Insights for FacturSimple

1. **Vertical positioning is correct** — exactly what Rob Walling recommends for 2026
2. **DNS blocker is critical** — 58 pages of SEO content waiting to index
3. **Consider €99/year pricing** — annual billing reduces churn 30%
4. **Build in public for French market** — transparency rare, could differentiate
5. **AI-native for V2** — photo-to-invoice, voice commands for differentiation
