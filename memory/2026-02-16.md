# 2026-02-16 - Research Session Notes

## Evening Research Session (9pm Bangkok / 2pm UTC)

### Sources Studied
- Rob Walling's Episode 813: "SaaS Predictions for 2026" (Startups for the Rest of Us)
- Full transcript analyzed and key insights extracted

### Key Findings

**Rob Walling's 2026 Predictions:**
1. Horizontal SaaS facing massive headwinds (venture + AI flooding markets)
2. SEO over-reliance becoming problematic (crowded, AI changing discovery)
3. Top brands grabbing more market share (AI recommends short lists)
4. AI VC bubble won't burst ($190B continued investment)
5. Open-source AI usage doubles (20% → 40%)
6. At least one major no-code platform struggles (vibe coding eating market)
7. M&A increases for small SaaS ($1-10M ARR targets)
8. Bitcoin $160K ATH (range $90-160K)
9. Stripe stays private

**New Frameworks Learned:**
- Core Four: Marketing, Sales, Product, Development
- 7-8 SaaS plateau causes (diagnosis > treatment)
- 12 Commandments episode (800)
- Brand emerges organically by ~$1M ARR

### Strategic Implications for VixPic

**Good news:**
- VixPic is orthogonal (BYOK niche), not horizontal - avoids headwinds
- Open-source AI growth aligns with BYOK philosophy
- Small AI-adjacent SaaS = M&A target potential

**Action items:**
- Don't over-rely on SEO (keep below 80% of acquisition)
- Diversify channels: IH build-in-public, integrations, partnerships
- Focus on becoming THE recommendation in BYOK image category

### Failed Fetches
- Starter Story Prerender.io article (paywalled)
- Medium $100K MRR article (truncated)
- Second Brave search (rate limited)

### Memory Updates
- Updated MEMORY.md with full Rob Walling predictions breakdown
- Added new section on market shifts and strategic implications
