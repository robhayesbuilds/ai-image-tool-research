## Research Session (9pm Bangkok / 2pm UTC)

### SaaS Resource Framework - How to Use Each Platform

**Indie Hackers (Real-time Community)**
- Best for: Raw, unfiltered founder journeys, real-time tactics
- Tactic: Filter by "Bootstrapped" + "SaaS", sort by revenue
- Study "Milestones" section - founders post exact tactics used
- Ask tactical questions, not generic ones ("What channel got you to $5K MRR?" not "How do I grow?")

**Starter Story (Curated Library)**
- Best for: Structured case studies, benchmarking
- Each interview follows consistent Q&A pattern for easy comparison
- Focus on: startup costs, MRR/ARR, team size, marketing channels
- "How You Grew" section = most valuable for tactics

**MicroConf Video Vault**
- Best for: Deep frameworks, polished tactical presentations
- Not motivational - actual tactical breakdowns
- 170+ hours of free content from proven founders

### LTD Platform Landscape 2026 (VixPic Launch Options)

| Platform | Best For | Refund Period | Take Rate |
|----------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **AppSumo** | Largest audience | 60 days | ~70% |
| **Pitchground** | SaaS-focused | 60 days | ~50% |
| **Dealify** | Startup tools | 30 days | Better splits |
| **Deal Mirror** | International reach | Varies | Flexible |
| **StackSocial** | Broad categories | 30 days | Unknown |

**VixPic Strategy Consideration:**
- AppSumo 70% cut = painful, but massive exposure
- Pitchground = better split, SaaS-focused audience
- Own site = 97% net (Stripe/Lemon Squeezy fees only)
- **Hybrid approach:** Own site LTD first → later AppSumo for scale?

### Prerender.io Case Study (Solo Founder $2.5M ARR)
- Solo founder, bootstrapped over 5 years
- SEO product (makes JS websites crawlable)
- Founded 2014, hit $2.5M ARR by 2019
- Key insight: Technical niche + developer audience = high LTV

### Key Insights for VixPic

1. **BYOK positioning is strong** - Orthogonal competition
2. **Developer API = power user segment** - SeamUI doesn't serve this
3. **LTD launch should be staged:**
   - Phase 1: Own site, early adopters, higher margin
   - Phase 2: Consider LTD platforms for exposure
4. **SEO + content still primary driver** for API/developer tools

## Build Session (Midnight Bangkok / 5pm UTC)

### Feature Built: Onboarding Flow for VixPic

Created a comprehensive first-time user experience to improve conversion:

**5-Step Onboarding Modal:**
1. **Welcome** - Introduction with key value props (80% cheaper, unlimited, private)
2. **Understand** - Explains BYOK concept with 3-step visual flow
3. **Choose** - Provider selection with recommendations:
   - Replicate (recommended) - Best for FLUX models
   - FAL.ai - Fastest generation
   - Together AI - $5 free credits
   - OpenAI - Best text rendering
4. **Setup** - Guided API key input with:
   - Direct link to provider signup
   - Format validation (sk-... for OpenAI, r8_... for Replicate)
   - Security reassurance
5. **Ready** - Quick tips and start creating button

**Technical Implementation:**
- `src/components/onboarding.tsx` - Full component with useOnboarding hook
- Integrated into `/generate` page
- Added "Show Tutorial Again" option in Settings
- Persistent state in localStorage
- Build verified: All pages compile successfully

**Files Changed:**
- `vixpic/app/src/components/onboarding.tsx` (new)
- `vixpic/app/src/app/generate/page.tsx` (integration)
- `vixpic/app/src/app/settings/page.tsx` (tutorial reset)

**Why This Matters:**
- BYOK is unfamiliar concept → needs explanation
- Without API keys, users can't use the app at all
- First impressions are critical for LTD conversions
- Reduces friction from "What is this?" to "Let me try"

### Next Steps for VixPic
1. Deploy to Vercel (needs credentials)
2. Add Stripe/Lemon Squeezy for payments
3. Build free tools (background removal, upscaling) as lead magnets
4. Create landing page content for SEO
