## Research Session (9pm Bangkok / 2pm UTC)

### SaaS Resource Framework - How to Use Each Platform

**Indie Hackers (Real-time Community)**
- Best for: Raw, unfiltered founder journeys, real-time tactics
- Tactic: Filter by "Bootstrapped" + "SaaS", sort by revenue
- Study "Milestones" section - founders post exact tactics used
- Ask tactical questions, not generic ones ("What channel got you to $5K MRR?" not "How do I grow?")

**Starter Story (Curated Library)**
- Best for: Structured case studies, benchmarking
- Each interview follows consistent Q&A pattern for easy comparison
- Focus on: startup costs, MRR/ARR, team size, marketing channels
- "How You Grew" section = most valuable for tactics

**MicroConf Video Vault**
- Best for: Deep frameworks, polished tactical presentations
- Not motivational - actual tactical breakdowns
- 170+ hours of free content from proven founders

### LTD Platform Landscape 2026 (VixPic Launch Options)

| Platform | Best For | Refund Period | Take Rate |
|----------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **AppSumo** | Largest audience | 60 days | ~70% |
| **Pitchground** | SaaS-focused | 60 days | ~50% |
| **Dealify** | Startup tools | 30 days | Better splits |
| **Deal Mirror** | International reach | Varies | Flexible |
| **StackSocial** | Broad categories | 30 days | Unknown |

**VixPic Strategy Consideration:**
- AppSumo 70% cut = painful, but massive exposure
- Pitchground = better split, SaaS-focused audience
- Own site = 97% net (Stripe/Lemon Squeezy fees only)
- **Hybrid approach:** Own site LTD first → later AppSumo for scale?

### Prerender.io Case Study (Solo Founder $2.5M ARR)
- Solo founder, bootstrapped over 5 years
- SEO product (makes JS websites crawlable)
- Founded 2014, hit $2.5M ARR by 2019
- Key insight: Technical niche + developer audience = high LTV

### Key Insights for VixPic

1. **BYOK positioning is strong** - Orthogonal competition
2. **Developer API = power user segment** - SeamUI doesn't serve this
3. **LTD launch should be staged:**
   - Phase 1: Own site, early adopters, higher margin
   - Phase 2: Consider LTD platforms for exposure
4. **SEO + content still primary driver** for API/developer tools
