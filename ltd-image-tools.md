## Major LTD Platforms

### AppSumo (Primary)

- **Commission:** ~50% typically
- **Refund Period:** 60 days
- **AI Stance:** Now openly discussing credit systems, moving away from "unlimited" promises

### StackSocial
- Smaller audience, less tech-savvy buyers
- Lower prices generally ($29-49 typical)
- Less rigorous vetting

### Lifetimo / DealMango / DealFuel
- Aggregators, not primary deal sources

## Common Problems & Complaints (Reddit/Reviews)

### 1. **LTD Terms Changing**
> "The original pitch was incredible: 15,000 credits refreshed every single month. But then, the terms quietly changed. The 'Lifetime Subscription' became a 'Lifetime Pre-paid Card.'" - r/appsumo

### 2. **Companies Going Bust**
> "I've bought at least 10 AI tools that either shut down, started charging for credits, or removed key features within 12-18 months." - r/SideProject

### 3. **Credit Systems Are Confusing**
> "I hate those like the plague" - common sentiment about credit systems

### 4. **AppSumo Support Issues**
> "Getting AppSumo to do anything is a joke. Getting the Software company to do something is also a joke." - r/SaaS

### 5. **Pixlr Example (Cautionary Tale)**
> "I contacted Pixlr support and they said they won't be able to fulfill their offer because of the AI costs... there's been no warning about it" - r/pixlr

### 6. **AI LTDs Are High Risk**
> "Lifetime deals just means: The company doesn't want a stable growing, sustainable revenue stream but rather bet on users to be the experiment mice and then shutdown the services entirely" - r/ChatGPTCoding
