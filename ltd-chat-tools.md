# AI Chat & Text Tools - Lifetime Deal Research

**Research Date:** February 5, 2026  
**Purpose:** Identify patterns in AI chat/text tools sold as lifetime deals

---

## Executive Summary

The AI chat/text LTD market is dominated by:
1. **Chatbot builders** for customer support (biggest category)
2. **Writing assistants** for text manipulation
3. **BYOK interfaces** for power users (niche but loyal)
4. **Email AI assistants** (emerging category)

**Key Finding:** The winning formula is a vertical-specific tool (e.g., Shopify chatbot, email assistant) rather than a generic ChatGPT wrapper. Generic BYOK tools struggle with monetization.
