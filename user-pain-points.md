## 💰 Pain Point #1: PRICING & COST COMPLAINTS

### Midjourney Pricing Frustrations

> "I canceled it because it's too much a month. Half the price would be decent."
— r/midjourney user

> "30$ is expensive for most of the countries in the world. That 30 usd is enough for one week of lunch and dinner for my country in south east Asia."
— r/midjourney user

> "The $10 plan would be affordable but seems like this lasts 4 hours. Which is a joke to me."
— r/midjourney user on basic plan limitations

> "Midjourney is a rip off - My 3060 paid for itself in a year. They charge like $30/month and employ a Karen to read your prompts AND TAKE THEM DOWN."
— r/StableDiffusion user explaining why they switched

> "I pay 6$ for Spotify every month because it's worth it... but Midjourney? 36$ every month?"
— User comparing value to other subscriptions

### Leonardo AI Credit Complaints

> "I had 30k credits. I cancelled my subscription and all my credits disappeared. WTF. I paid for those you can't just take them away??"
— r/leonardoai user, 24 upvotes

> "They tell you your credits expire on a certain day but never disclose the time and then customer service refuses to re-credit you for the tokens you paid for."
— r/LovedByCreators user

> "The fact that your previous month's credits do NOT roll over and apparently reset at the beginning of the next subscription month is also information people need to know."
— r/leonardoai user warning others

> "Credits are being wasted actually and for paying people it's kinda not good."
— r/leonardoai user on quality issues

> "Leonardo's token system is a perfect example of how costs can get out of hand. A busy month creating marketing videos or generating high-res product shots could blow through your budget unexpectedly."
— eesel.ai blog

### Ideogram Credit Frustrations

> "I'm no expert here, but without daily credits to get people addicted to the sauce, they will get bored and move on elsewhere. I was thinking about signing up, but after this 10 a week limit I find it kind of pointless."
— r/ideogramai user on free tier limits

> "I really liked Ideogram initially and was perfectly fine with the free plan. But then they steadily reduced the free credits to the point of two being used at once and only allowing for 5 creations every 24 hours."
— r/ideogramai user

> "At $60 per month, Midjourney was simply too expensive for my use."
— Blog review explaining switch to Ideogram

### General Pricing Fatigue

> "The average professional juggling ChatGPT Plus ($20), Claude Pro ($20), Midjourney ($10), and Perplexity Pro ($20) spends $70/month—$840 annually—just on AI tools."
— AIonX pricing comparison

> "Not really worth it, imo... if you have an image in mind, you may have the software generate thousands before you find a pic you like. At 10 cents an image, it could get costly."
— r/aiArt user on per-image costs

---

## 😤 Pain Point #2: SUBSCRIPTION FATIGUE

### Too Many AI Subscriptions

> "Looking for a New Way to Access AI Tools Without Subscription Fatigue"
— r/ArtificialInteligence thread title

> "Lifetime deals on platforms like AppSumo or StackSocial are great for avoiding subscription fatigue, offering one-time payments for AI tools."
— Reddit suggestion for avoiding monthly fees

> "Tired of juggling multiple AI subscriptions?"
— Common sentiment across r/SideProject and r/SaaS

> "We've hit peak AI subscription fatigue. By October 2025, you can barely scroll 10 seconds without bumping into a new 'AI productivity' tool claiming to transform your workflow — and of course, all it takes is yet another monthly payment."
— Medium article

> "Bundling could definitely help with subscription fatigue."
— r/SaaS user responding to bundle proposal

### Annual Subscription Traps

> "MidJourney's Annual Subscription Feels Like a Scam. I forgot to cancel in Dec 2024 so it didn't auto renew and once it had auto renewed it was kinda in for a penny in for a pound so I've got a ton of reminders to cancel this Dec."
— r/midjourney user

> "The 'unlimited' subscription was a scam with big delays."
— r/AIAssisted user on Higgsfield

---

## 🚫 Pain Point #3: CENSORSHIP & CONTENT MODERATION

### Midjourney's Over-Aggressive Moderation

> "The AI Moderator is ridiculous. I then asked myself what's the point of paying for a service that you can't actually use, so I cancelled my subscription."
— r/midjourney user

> "Midjourney's censorship is getting exceedingly more restrictive. If a reference image of a woman has any sort of cleavage now, the Midjourney AI Moderator nukes it (along with the fact that you can't use any keywords to describe a woman's body type now)."
— r/StableDiffusion user considering switch

> "Censorship is going crazy. Considering cancelling my subscription. I design romance novel covers. They're historical so the people are always fully dressed in my prompts. Occasionally I've used the word 'muscular' and turned up with a pic of a shirtless man. So Midjourney does this on its own."
— r/midjourney user

> "Do you want happy people of color? Forget it, 'request cancelled due to image filters'. LGBTQ+ representation? Nope, AI moderator."
— r/midjourney user on over-filtering

> "Seriously, fuck midjourney!"
— r/aiArt user searching for alternatives without censorship

### Users Switching to Local Due to Censorship

> "I cancelled mine for the same reason more or less, started running stable diffusion locally, much more freedom."
— r/midjourney user

> "If you install Stable Diffusion on your computer, there is no censoring."
— r/midjourney user advising others

---

## 🔒 Pain Point #4: PRIVACY & OWNERSHIP CONCERNS

### Public by Default

> "Anything you generate is visible to others on the Discord server and may appear in their public gallery. No ownership of outputs unless you're on a Pro Plan ($60/mo), which includes stealth mode."
— ContentBeta comparison article

> "Besides in Discord, there used to be users who would check private galleries and report them to moderators."
— r/midjourney user on privacy concerns

### Copyright Confusion

> "AI images cannot be copyrighted."
— Common Reddit understanding

> "U.S. copyright law requires human authorship. The Copyright Office has consistently denied registration to works that lack 'human creative input.'"
— VLP Law Group blog

> "You do not need to have copyright to use an image commercially."
— r/aiArt clarification, though many users still confused

> "There is no clarity about copyright for AI generated images."
— r/StableDiffusion user expressing frustration

### Commercial Use Uncertainty

> "Is it legal to use AI generated art to sell merchandises?"
— Common question on r/COPYRIGHT

> "Images created by Midjourney and other generative AIs can't be copyrighted. This means that even though you're free to use images you generate commercially, you have limited recourse."
— Zapier blog explaining copyright situation

---

## 🔌 Pain Point #5: NO API ACCESS

### Midjourney API Frustration

> "MidJourney NEEDS an API. Why does it not have one yet?"
— r/midjourney thread title

> "Currently trying to use Dalle3 as part of a programmatic workflow that requires text-to-AI image."
— r/midjourney user needing API

> "The problem is that Midjourney doesn't provide an API, it works from Discord. How to automate the process of image generation without the need to open Discord?"
— StackOverflow question

> "The real question is why Midjourney not letting API usage in the first place."
— r/SaaS user

> "Don't understand why they won't release one - their pricing already includes fast hours for different tiers."
— r/midjourney user

### Workflow Integration Needs

> "Seamless (Web, App, SaaS) integration... High (for bulk generation)... Automated workflows, product integration."
— UserAPI marketing highlighting what Midjourney lacks

---

## 🎓 Pain Point #6: COMPLEXITY OF LOCAL ALTERNATIVES

### Stable Diffusion / ComfyUI Learning Curve

> "ComfyUI way too difficult for me. What a disaster. The results I see image wise are horrible, much much worse than any of the commercial image AI generator. Also, the software is really complicated and convoluted with way too many options that I will forget very easy if I do not use it often."
— r/StableDiffusion user

> "I am fucking done with ComfyUI and sincerely wish it wasn't the absolute standard for local generation."
— r/StableDiffusion frustrated user

> "Sometimes everything is working fine and then just installing/updating an extension/comfy breaks everything and you have to move earth and heavens to try and fix it. Not to mention the learning curve for it."
— r/StableDiffusion user

> "Stable Diffusion on the other hand is free and highly customizable but requires good hardware and knowledge to produce Midjourney-like results."
— r/StableDiffusion comparison

> "It has a steeper learning curve but it is worth it imo."
— Common refrain, implying barrier to entry

> "Yea stable diffusion but it is way less user friendly. Or at least you need a serious skillcap to generate comfortably what you want."
— r/midjourney user acknowledging complexity

### Hardware Requirements

> "None of my computers are able to generate AI images at a reasonable speed, so I have to pay for play."
— r/aiArt user explaining subscription necessity

---

## 📉 Pain Point #7: UNPREDICTABLE COSTS & VALUE

### Credits Running Out Unexpectedly

> "150 credits is a good amount per day but it makes learning slow."
— r/leonardoai user on free tier limitations

> "25000 credits on Motion 2.0 is equivalent to 10.4 minutes of video, that's nothing."
— r/leonardoai user on video generation costs

> "If you have a crazy busy month followed by a quiet one, you could end up paying for hundreds of credits that just disappear into thin air."
— eesel.ai blog on Ideogram

### Quality vs Cost Mismatch

> "These video AI generators are not worth it, the tech just isn't there yet and they are too expensive."
— r/leonardoai user

> "The models used on OpenArt are the most up to date... but that's the only positive. All in all, it's not worth it like others have said. Too expensive."
— r/generativeAI user
